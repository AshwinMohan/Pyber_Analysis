# Pyber_Analysis
The Reason that we did this assignment was to simulate an understanding of ride sharing data and further our knowledge of Python and Pandas to analyze the Pyber Data and understand for our CEO , VIsualize the relationships between location ( urban , suburban and rural ) and Pyber revenue usage and average price. We also analyzed the relations between the other variables, to maximize our understanding of the business.

  One main struggle I had was converting the data to the Plot Chart, unfortunately I was unable to do that. I didn't know how to find the data to graph those relationships.

I would recommend that we also show the CEO how density affects prices instead of just classifying it as urban, suburban , or rural , we find a relationship between population density and price. I would also bring in total population size , which might also be a key variable in explaining the data.
